# Store records about phone payments

You can store records about phone payments in your GOV.UK Pay account using the API, if you want to report on both:
 
- online payments you take using GOV.UK Pay
- phone payments that a third-party provider processes for you

You can then track, refund and report on phone payments using the API or by signing in to the GOV.UK Pay admin tool. 

## Requirements

You can only store records about phone payments if all of the following apply:

- you already take payments online using GOV.UK Pay
- a third-party provider processes your phone payments
- your payment service provider (PSP) is Worldpay
- you can set up your Worldpay merchant account to send all your Worldpay notifications to GOV.UK Pay

We cannot send email notifications to your users about phone payments.
