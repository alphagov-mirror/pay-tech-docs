# Payment flow

This section outlines how your service will interact with GOV.UK Pay after you integrate with the API.

There's a different process for [taking Direct Debit payments](/direct_debit/#direct-debit).

## Overview

The following diagram outlines the payment process for a service that has a GOV.UK Pay
integration:

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/pay-govuk-documentation/Card+payment+process.png)

The diagram shows the relationship between GOV.UK Pay, payment service providers
(PSPs) and issuing banks.

When your user needs to make a payment, your service makes an API call to
create a new payment, then redirects your user to the payment pages hosted on
GOV.UK Pay.

Your user enters their payment details (for example payment card
details and billing address) on the GOV.UK Pay pages. GOV.UK Pay verifies the
payment with the underlying PSP.

After the transaction reaches a final state, your user is then redirected
back to your service.

A final state means that the payment:

* succeeds

* fails because it is declined

* fails because your user chooses to cancel

* fails due to a technical error

* fails because it is cancelled by your service

* expires - your user has 90 minutes to complete a payment once it's created

When your user arrives back at your service, you can use the API to check the
status of the transaction and show them an appropriate message.

The following diagram illustrates the states a payment can pass through before
reaching a final state:

## Making a payment

In your service, you may host a series of pages which allows your user to choose
between a variety of possible payments. At the end of this, you may have a
page where your user needs to make a payment. The following image shows an
example:

![](/images/flow-service-pay-page.png)

This page should make it clear to your user that they are about to pay for your
product or service, with a clear call to action. For example a button that
says __Pay now__ or __Continue to payment__. Your user will then be taken to
the GOV.UK Pay pages to complete their transaction.

The page should include clear information on what is being purchased. You do
not need to tell your user that they are being taken to GOV.UK Pay’s
pages to make their payment.

> GOV.UK Pay payment pages are responsive and work on both desktop and mobile.

In the example page, when your user selects __Continue__, the service makes a
<a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#newpayment"
target="blank">Create new payment</a> call to the GOV.UK Pay API. The body of the call is returned in JSON.

For example:

```javascript
{
  "amount": 14500,
  "reference" : "12345",
  "description": "Pay your council tax",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed"
}
```

where:

- `amount` is the amount in pence - in the example, the payment is for £145
- `reference` is the reference number you want to associate with this payment
- `description` is a human-readable description of the payment shown to your user
- `return_url` is an HTTPS URL on your site that your user will be sent back to once they have completed their payment attempt on GOV.UK Pay

Read more about [making payments](/making_payments/).

You can [prefill the fields on the payment page](/optional_features/prefill_user_details) with your user's details if you collected that information:

- earlier in your service
- when your user previously used your service

In the example, responses to the __Create new payment__ API call would have
headers of the form:

```response
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/icus7b4umg4b4g5fat4831es5f
```

And response bodies would be of the form:

```javascript
{
  "payment_id": "icus7b4umg4b4g5fat4831es5f",
  "payment_provider": "acme",
  "amount": 14500,
  "state": {
    "status": "created",
    "finished": false
  },
  "description": "Payment description",
  "return_url": "https://your.service.gov.uk/completed",
  "reference": "12345",
  "created_date": "2016-06-24T11:46:11.414Z",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/payments/icus7b4umg4b4g5fat4831es5f",
      "method": "GET"
    },
    "next_url": {
      "href": "https://publicapi.payments.service.gov.uk/secure/bb0a272c-8eaf-468d-b3xf-ae5e000d2231",
      "method": "GET"
    },
 ...}
}
```

The start of the response confirms the properties of the attempted payment.

The `self` URL (also provided in the Location header of the response) is a
unique identifier for the payment. It can be used to retrieve the payment status
details in future.

The `next_url` is the URL where your service should direct your user next.
It points to a payment page hosted by GOV.UK Pay where your user can enter
their payment details. This is a one-time URL. If more than one visit is attempted,
it will give an error message.

When your service redirects your user to `next_url`, they’ll see an __Enter
card details__ page similar to the following image:

![](/images/flow-payment-details-page.png)

This page shows the `description` as well as the amount your user has to
pay, making it clear what they’re paying for.

Your user enters their payment details and selects __Continue__.

GOV.UK Pay will then attempt a payment authorisation through the PSP. This
checks with the card issuer whether there are sufficient funds available to
make this payment. It also conducts anti-fraud checks.

## Payment successful

If the details are valid and the payment is approved by the PSP, your user is
then taken to a payment confirmation page, still hosted by GOV.UK Pay. Your
user then decides whether or not to complete their payment:

![](/images/flow-payment-confirm-page.png)

If your user decides to complete the payment, they select __Confirm__. They will then:

* receive a confirmation email, if you have chosen to send these using GOV.UK Pay
* be redirected to your `return_url` page which will then send your user to your payment confirmation page

You'll receive the payment in your bank account within either:

- 2 business days
- 3 business days if your user completed their payment after 11pm

It may take longer if the payment is below the minimum 'payout', which is the total amount you must receive from your users before your PSP will transfer payments to you. If you're using GOV.UK's PSP, the minimum payout is £1.

If you're using GOV.UK's PSP, payments will show on your bank statement as 'STRIPE PAYMENTS UKGOV.UKPAY'.

### Confirmation email

If you have set up confirmation emails, your user will receive a payment
confirmation email containing:

* a payment reference number

* the date of payment

* who the payment was made to

* the total payment amount

You can add a custom paragraph to a payment confirmation email at the [email
notifications
page](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/email-notifications) on the
GOV.UK Pay admin tool.

You can further customise using [GOV.UK
Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) to set up custom
notifications. If you do this, you should disable GOV.UK Pay
notifications.

### Confirmation page

The confirmation page is hosted by your service and should:

* confirm that payments have been received successfully

* contain a reference number, which should be short

* have a clear payment summary, showing the amount and description

* clearly state what is going to happen next - this will be different for each service

* if applicable, let your user know they will receive a receipt email (using GOV.UK Notify or GOV.UK Pay)

Your users have different ways of recording this confirmation information. This can
include screenshots, prints, PDF receipts to download, and writing down the
reference number and other relevant information. Teams building services
should be aware of all these behaviours, and plan accordingly.

You can read more about confirmation pages as used in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/confirmation-pages).

## Payment failure

The payment can fail at any point in the process due to:

* your user cancelling the payment

* the payment being declined

* your service cancelling the payment

* a technical error

If the payment fails, your user will see a GOV.UK Pay error page, which
includes a __Continue__ button. When your user selects this, your service should
show them a page that confirms that the payment failed. This should either:

* offer your user a chance to try the payment again by starting a new payment with GOV.UK Pay, or using another method that your service provides

* advise your user of an alternative course of action

The following image is an example failure page:

![](/images/flow-payment-declined.png)

You can also choose to [use your own payment failure pages](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/optional_features/use_your_own_error_pages/#use-your-own-payment-failure-pages)

## Check the status of a payment

Regardless of the payment outcome, when a payment journey has reached a final
state, GOV.UK Pay will return your user to the `return_url` provided in the
initial request.

The `return_url` should specify a page on your service. When your user visits
the `return_url`, your service should:

* match your returning user with their payment (with a secure cookie, or a secure random ID string included in the `return_url`)

* check the status of the payment using an API call

* display an appropriate final page, hosted by your service

The [__Making payments__](/making_payments/#making-payments) section contains
more details about how to match your users to payments.

To check the status of a payment, you must make a <a
href="https://govukpay-api-browser.cloudapps.digital/#getpayment"
target="blank">Find payment by ID</a> API call,
using the `payment_id` of the payment as the parameter.

The URL to do this is the same as the `self` URL provided in the response
when the payment was first created.

The response body contains information about the payment in JSON
format. The following is the start of a typical response:

```javascript
{
  "payment_id": "i3us7bqumg4b4g5fae48h1es5f",
  "payment_provider": "acme",
  "amount": 14500,
  "state": {
    "status": "success",
    "finished": true
  },
...
}
```

The `state` array within the JSON lets you know the outcome of the payment:

* `status` describes a stage of the payment journey

* `finished` indicates if the payment journey is complete or not - that is, if the `status` of this payment can change

See the [__Making payments__](/making_payments/#making-payments) section for
more information about how you can integrate your service with GOV.UK Pay.

### Resuming an incomplete payment

You can send your user back to GOV.UK Pay if they return to your service before they've finished their payment.

[Get information about the payment](/reporting/#get-information-about-a-single-payment) to check the payment's `status`. The payment is incomplete if the `status` is one of the following:

- `created`
- `started`
- `submitted`

Resume the payment by redirecting your user to the `next_url` in the API response.

You should not reuse the `next_url` you received in the original API response when you first created the payment. Each `next_url` has a unique token so you can only use that `next_url` once.

We'll take your user to a screen that's appropriate for the status of the payment. For example, if the `status` of the payment is `submitted`, we'll show the **Confirm your payment** page.

You cannot resume a payment if the `status` is `failed`, `cancelled` or `error`. [Create a new payment](/making_payments/#creating-a-payment) instead.

## Payment expires

Payments that are not confirmed and completed after 90 minutes will expire
automatically.

If the payment was authorised but incomplete, GOV.UK Pay will send a
cancellation to the payment provider. This will raise a [P0020 API
error](/api_reference/#api-errors-caused-by-payment-statuses).
