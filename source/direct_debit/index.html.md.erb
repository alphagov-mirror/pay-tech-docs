# Direct Debit

You can use Direct Debit if you want to take recurring payments.

You can take payments whenever you need to. You can take the same amount or a different amount each time.

You cannot automatically schedule payments. If you need to take regular payments, you could create your own scheduler to send API calls on a set schedule.

## Before you start

If you’d like to set up Direct Debit, [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) to be one of our pilot partners.

Direct Debit is not currently available to central government departments or the NHS. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you’d like to know more.

### Set up an account with our Direct Debit supplier

1. Sign in to the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

1. Select your account in the __My services__ page and follow the on-screen instructions.

You must [contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) before you switch to live, so we can send you your GoCardless contract to sign.

## Set up a mandate

Before you can take payments, your user needs to set up a Direct Debit mandate (also known as an 'instruction') by entering their bank account details on a GOV.UK Pay page.

A mandate is your user's agreement that you can take payments from their bank account.

These steps happen in order.

### 1. GOV.UK Pay creates the mandate

API call: `POST /v1/directdebit/mandates`

You must include the following required parameters in your API call:

- `reference`
- `return_url`

You can include the optional `description` parameter in your API call.

#### reference (required)

`reference` is a reference number you want to associate with this mandate.

The reference number does not need to be unique, and can be any data type as long as it does not:

- be longer than 255 characters
- contain URLs

#### return_url (required)

`return_url` is an HTTPS URL on your site. GOV.UK Pay will direct your user to this URL when GOV.UK Pay have finished setting up the mandate.

The URL should not be JSON-encoded, because backslashes are invalid characters in the API.

#### description (optional)

`description` is a human-readable description of the mandate.

The description must be no longer than 255 characters, and must not contain URLs.

### 2. Direct your user to GOV.UK Pay

When the API responds, you need to:

- direct your user to the `next_url` from the API response
- store the `mandate_id` from the API response, so you can use that ID to collect payments against the mandate later

### 3. Your user provides their bank account details

When your service redirects your user to `next_url`, your user will see a **Set up a Direct Debit** page. Your user enters their bank account details and selects **Continue**.

GOV.UK Pay checks with GoCardless that your user’s account number and sort code match a real bank account.

### 4. GOV.UK Pay presents your user with a confirmation screen

The screen presents your user’s account details. Your user grants their consent
by selecting __Confirm__.  GOV.UK Pay sends an email to your user to confirm
that their mandate is being set up.

### 5. GOV.UK Pay securely passes your user's details on to GoCardless

GoCardless submits a request to BACS to set up a mandate, and
sends a mandate ID to GOV.UK Pay. At this point, you can send a payment
request.

If the mandate then fails, the
GOV.UK Pay team will send an email to update your user that their mandate could
not be set up.

### 6. GOV.UK Pay returns your user to your service using the `return_url`

### 7. Call the API to check the status of the mandate

API call: `GET /v1/directdebit/mandates/<mandateid>`

The API response includes a `state` object. This includes the following parameters:

- [`status`](#mandate-statuses)
- [`details`](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference/#events-mandate-causes), which explains the reason for the `status`

You should use these `status` and `details` parameters to display an appropriate final page to your user.

The `status` will be `pending` until your user's bank confirms the mandate. The mandate confirmation process takes 2 working days.

You can also check the status of a mandate by signing into your GoCardless account through the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

## Collecting payments against a mandate

API call: `POST /v1/directdebit/payments`

Required arguments:

```
{
   "amount"
   "reference"
   "mandate_id"
}
```

Optional argument:

```
{
   "description"
}
```

Once a mandate has a `status` of `pending`, you can make an API call to collect a payment against the mandate.

GoCardless will take the payment from your user's bank account in:

- 3 working days if the mandate's `status` is `pending`
- 2 working days if the mandate's `status` is `active`

It then takes a further one working day before the payment reaches your service’s bank account.

GOV.UK Pay will send an email to your user giving them 2 working days' advance
notification that payment will be collected against their mandate. The email will contain the mandate reference number.

You can collect payments whenever you need to. You may collect between £1 and £5000 each
time. [Contact us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#contact-us) if you need to collect more than £5000 at any one time.

### Getting information about a payment

The call to check the status of a payment with the GOV.UK Pay API is:

`GET /v1/directdebit/payments/<paymentid>`

If the payment exists, the API response will include a `state` object. This includes the following parameters:

- [`status`](#payment-statuses)
- [`details`](https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference/#events-payment-causes), which explains the reason for the `status`

You can also check the status of a payment by signing into your GoCardless account through the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/login).

## Generating a list of mandates or payments

You can use the API to search mandates or payments and return a list of results.

### Searching mandates

The call to search mandates with the GOV.UK Pay API is:

`GET /v1/directdebit/mandates?<queryparameters>`

For example:

`GET /v1/directdebit/mandates?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&reference=12345&status=pending`

The query parameters you can use to search are:

- `reference` - case insensitive, exact match only
- `bank_statement_reference` - case insensitive, exact match only
- `email` - case insensitive
- `name` - case insensitive
- `state` - case sensitive, exact match only

If you search for a specific mandate, all criteria you use must match. Otherwise your search will not return that mandate in the results.

If your request has no query parameters, the API will return all mandates.

### Searching payments

The call to search payments with the GOV.UK Pay API is:

`GET /v1/directdebit/payments?<queryparameters>`

For example:

`GET /v1/directdebit/payments?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&reference=12345&status=success`

The query parameters you can use to search are:

- `reference` - case insensitive
- `mandate_id` - case insensitive
- `state` - case sensitive

All the parameters must be an exact match.

If you search for a specific payment, all criteria you use must match. Otherwise your search will not return that payment in the results.

If your request has no query parameters, the API will return all payments.

### Filtering by date

You can use the following query parameters to filter mandates or payments by date:

* `from_date`, which is the start date to search, inclusive

* `to_date`, which is the end date to search, exclusive

Dates must be in [ISO
8601 format](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-standards-for-government/date-times-and-time-stamps-standard). For example `2015-08-13T12:35:00Z`.

### Splitting results into pages

You can use the following query parameters to split results into pages:

* `display-size`, which has a default of `500`, and must be between `1` and `500`
* `page`, which has a default of `1`

These must be a positive integer.

For example, you run the following search and get 1500 mandates in the response:

`GET
/v1/directdebit/mandates?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z`

You could then get a single page of these mandates by running:

`GET
/v1/directdebit/mandates?from_date=2018-10-01T13:30:00Z&to_date=2018-10-14T15:00:00Z&display-size=500&page=2`

This would return payments 501 to 1000.

## Reference numbers

You can control what appears on your users’ bank account statements.  You'll
enter this when you set up your account with GoCardless.

GoCardless will generate a mandate reference number, which is
given to your users in the confirmation email. The first part of the reference
will be generated from the account name you enter with the Direct Debit
supplier. This is limited to 12 characters.

When you create a mandate for a variable Direct Debit, you can also create
your own reference. You may want to do this so you can link an existing
case record with the Direct Debit transaction. References that your service
supplies with mandates will not be shown to your users.

Your users will only receive the mandate reference number generated by the Direct
Debit supplier. It’s a mandatory requirement of the Direct Debit scheme that
your users receive their mandate reference number.

## Refunds

If a user asks you for a refund, you can process the refund by signing into your GoCardless account through the [GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/).

If the payment's status is `indemnityclaim`, you do not need to do anything because your user's bank will have refunded the payment. If you disagree with the refund, read about [how to dispute the claim](https://support.gocardless.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115002875285-Chargebacks-Customer-Claims#disputing_a_chargeback) on the GoCardless website.
