# Connect your live account to ePDQ

This is part of [going live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

You must be an admin on both your:

- GOV.UK Pay account
- ePDQ account

## Add payment methods to your account

If you only want to accept Visa and Mastercard, you do not need to follow these steps, because ePDQ will have already added them by default.

1. Sign in to your [ePDQ account](https://payments.epdq.co.uk/Ncol/Prod/BackOffice/login/index).

2. Select the __Configuration__ tab, then __Payment methods__.

3. Select __Choose new payment methods__.

4. Select __Add__ next to the card types you want to accept.

5. Complete the fields on the __Contract data__ tab, then select __Submit__.

6. Select the __PM activation__ tab, then select __Yes__ for __Activation__.

7. Select __Submit__.

## Set up security parameters

### Set the hashing method

1. Select the __Configuration__ tab.

2. On the __Technical Information__ tab, select the __Global security parameters__ tab.

3. Set __Hash algorithm__ to __SHA-512__.

should the status of a transaction change offline__ field, enter `https://notifications.payments.service.gov.uk/v1/api/notifications/epdq`
