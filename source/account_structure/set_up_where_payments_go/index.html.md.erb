# Set up which bank accounts your payments go to

To help you reconcile payments, you can send payments from your services to:

- the same bank account
- different bank accounts

GOV.UK Pay services are free, and there's no limit to how many you can create. Your payment service provider (PSP) may charge you for each PSP account you have, unless you use GOV.UK Pay's PSP.

## Send payments to the same bank account

You can send payments from a group of your services to the same bank account.

1. [Create a GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) for each of your services.

2. When you [go live](/switching_to_live/#go-live), in each GOV.UK Pay service add either:

- the same bank account number - if you use Stripe
- the same PSP merchant code

You can also [create a single GOV.UK Pay service instead](/account_structure/set_up_where_services_link_to#link-your-services-to-a-single-gov-uk-pay-service) if you need to easily manage the following across the whole group:

- your staff members' access in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool
- your account settings, for example which card types you accept

If you need to know which service each payment came from when you [report on payments](/reporting), you can:

- add different [reference numbers](/making_payments/#reference)
- add different [descriptions](/making_payments/#description)
- use [custom metadata](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata)

## Send payments to different bank accounts

If you need to send payments from your services to different bank accounts, you must create separate GOV.UK Pay services.

You cannot send payments from one GOV.UK Pay service to more than one bank account.

### If you use Stripe

1. [Create a GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) for each bank account you want to use.
2. Decide whether to [link one or more of your services to each GOV.UK Pay service](/account_structure/set_up_where_services_link_to) you created.
3. When you [go live](/switching_to_live/#go-live), add the bank account number you want to use to each GOV.UK Pay service.

### If you use Worldpay, ePDQ or SmartPay

1. Create a new PSP merchant code for each bank account you want to use.
2. [Create a GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) for each PSP merchant code.
3. Decide whether to [link one or more of your services to each GOV.UK Pay service](/account_structure/set_up_where_services_link_to) you created.
4. When you [go live](/switching_to_live/#go-live), add the PSP merchant code you want to use to each GOV.UK Pay service.
