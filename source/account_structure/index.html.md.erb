# Deciding whether to combine accounts and payments
  
You should set up your GOV.UK Pay services and payment service provider (PSP) accounts so you can more easily report on and reconcile your payments, and manage your services. 

GOV.UK Pay services are free, and there's no limit to how many you can create. Your PSP may charge you for each PSP account you have.

## Decide whether to combine your users' payments 

Each GOV.UK Pay service you create can take payments for either:

- one of your services
- 2 or more of your services combined

### Take payments for one service

If a GOV.UK Pay service takes payments for only one of your services, you can:

- give your service its own name on GOV.UK Pay's payment pages
- report on your service's payments separately
- send your service's payments to a dedicated bank account
- give your staff members access to your service separately in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool

To change a service's name, go to the [**My services** page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

### Take payments for 2 or more services combined

If a GOV.UK Pay service takes payments for 2 or more of your services combined:

- you can more easily report on all the services' payments together
- you can more easily change a setting across all the services, for example which card types you accept
- you may need to use a different [reference number](/making_payments/#reference) or add [custom metadata](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata) for each of your services, so you can tell which service each payment comes from
- you cannot give the services different names
- you cannot send payments to different bank accounts

To set up your services like this, use the same API key to create a payment in all of your services that you want to combine.

## Decide whether to combine your bank payments

To help you reconcile payments, each PSP account you create can receive money from either:

- one GOV.UK Pay service
- 2 or more GOV.UK Pay services combined - unless you use Stripe

If you want one PSP account to recieve money from 2 or more GOV.UK Pay services, add the same merchant code to each GOV.UK Pay service when you [go live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

You cannot send money from one GOV.UK Pay service to different PSP accounts.

### Change which bank accounts your PSP sends money to

You can change which bank accounts your PSP sends money to by:

- [contacting us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#support) if your PSP is Stripe
- [contacting Government Banking](mailto:serviceteam.gbs@hmrc.gov.uk) if you're using Government Banking's contracted PSP
- contacting your PSP directly
