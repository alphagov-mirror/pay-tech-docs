# Setting up multiple services
  
If you have more than one online service, you can set up your GOV.UK Pay account and payment service provider (PSP) accounts so it's easier to manage your payments and services.

## Decide where to send users

You can send your users to make payments with either:

- a different GOV.UK Pay service for each of your services
- a combined GOV.UK Pay service

### Send your users to different GOV.UK Pay services

Send your users to a different GOV.UK Pay service for each of your services if you need to do any of the following:

- give each service its own name on the GOV.UK Pay payment pages
- report on each service's payments separately
- send each service's payments to different bank accounts
- give your staff members access to each service separately in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool

To set up your services like this, [create a new GOV.UK Pay service](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services/create) for each of your online services.

GOV.UK Pay services are free, and there's no limit to how many you can create.

To change a service's name, go to the [**My services** page in the GOV.UK Pay admin tool](https://selfservice.payments.service.gov.uk/my-services).

### Send your users to a combined GOV.UK Pay service

Send your users to a combined GOV.UK Pay service if you need to:

- report on all the services' payments together
- change settings easily across all the services, for example which card types you accept

You will not be able to give the services different names or send payments to different bank accounts.

You may need to use a different [reference number](/making_payments/#reference) or add [custom metadata](/custom_metadata/#add-custom-metadata) for each of your services, so you can tell which service each payment comes from.

To set up a group of your services like this, use the same API key or payment link for all the services in the group.

## Decide where to send payments

To help you reconcile payments, each GOV.UK Pay service can send payments to a:

- separate PSP account and bank account
- combined PSP account and back account - unless you use Stripe

To set up a combined PSP account, add the same PSP merchant code to each GOV.UK Pay service when you [go live](/switching_to_live/#go-live).

If you send payments to separate PSP accounts, your PSP may charge you for each PSP account you have.

You cannot send money from one GOV.UK Pay service to different PSP accounts.

### Change which bank accounts your PSP sends money to

You can change which bank accounts your PSP sends money to by:

- [contacting us](/support_contact_and_more_information/#support) if your PSP is Stripe
- [contacting Government Banking](mailto:serviceteam.gbs@hmrc.gov.uk) if you're using Government Banking's contracted PSP
- contacting your PSP directly
